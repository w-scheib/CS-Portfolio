 <h1>Does cereal placement on shelves affect obesity in children?</h1>


 <h2>Visual 1</h2>


 <p>This chart shows colored dots based on where the cereal are placed, like top shelf, middle shelf and bottom shelf. <br>


   It also shows the number of calories in the cereal. So the higher the numbers are on the Y axis they have more calories.

 <h2>Visual 2</h2>


 <p>


   This pie chart shows us the male-female ratio of obestiy in the world's population based off of age.<br>


   As you can see on the graphs, it shows that as you go up in age


   the male obesity ratio goes up and the female ratio goes down.<br>

 <h2>Visual 3</h2>


 <p>


    This shows the content of sugar in cereals on shelves. <br>


   As you can see on the visual, the highest contents of sugar in cereals are on the top shelf.<br>


   This tells us that stores and companies are not targeting little kids by how much sugar a box of cereal has.

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>


 <p>
   After looking at the data and several graphs, we came to the conclusion that the placement
   of cereal on shelves does NOT contribute to childhood obesity. If anything, it tries to stop childhood
   obesity. We think this because the cereals with the most sugar content are on the top shelves, away from
   the reach and eyesight of little children.
