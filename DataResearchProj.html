 <h2>Conclusion</h2>

 <p>After looking at the data and several graphs, we came to the conclusion that the placement<br>
 of cereal on shelves does NOT contribute to childhood obesity. If anything, it tries to stop childhood<br>
 obesity. We think this because the cereals with the most sugar content are on the top shelves, away from<br>
 the reach and eyesight of little children.<br>
